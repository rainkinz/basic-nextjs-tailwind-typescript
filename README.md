## Introduction

This is simply some boiler plate stuff that sets up Next.JS, using typescript, and tailwind. In particular:

* Set the port that next runs on to 4000.
* Sets up Tailwind for Next.JS.
* Set up the base dir to '.' so that they components etc can be imported using `import ComponentNmae from 'component/ComponentName.tsx'` etc.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.
